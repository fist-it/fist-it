### Internet animal tierlist

I dont have the heart to divide them into groups, so it's just a top list, with no tiers

##### 1. Chewchan

Simply the best, in some photos he looks like a cloud

##### 2. Kotaro

From the front with a good angle he looks like an egg,
very cute and judgemental cat

##### 3. Uni

This is a very famous cat, he often gets mistaken for Maxwell cat, which makes
me slightly annoyed. Uni has some silly hats and accesories that his owner puts on him

##### 4. Panko

She's named after Panko flour, she is also slightly crosseyed

##### 6. Dougy

He looks like a human in a suit, in some videos I question if he really is a dog
